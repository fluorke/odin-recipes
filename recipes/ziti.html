        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ul class="steps">
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in ziti and return to a
                    boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite,
                    about 8 minutes. Drain well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; cook and stir until brown,
                    about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>
                    Stir together ricotta, onion, egg, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in
                    pasta, sausage, salt, pepper, and the half jar of spaghetti sauce; mix well.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>
                    Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with 1/3 of the full jar spaghetti sauce. Layer with 1/2 of
                    the pasta mixture, 1/2 of the remaining spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Repeat layers
                    once more using remaining pasta, sauce, and cheese. Sprinkle basil over top and cover the dish tightly
                    with aluminum foil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; return to the oven and bake
                    until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.
                </p>
